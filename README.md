Module 3 Homework

The code for each portion of the assignment (PyBank and PyPoll) can be found in the corresponding folder and is titled 'main.py'. The analysis text document for each portion of the assignment can be found in the corresponding folder in the 'analysis' folder. When not sure what code to use or how to use it, I refered to class notes and, per instructor recommendation, utilized ChatGPT to help learn how to do it. Otherwise, no other code or outside resources were used.
